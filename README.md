## TO RUN THIS APPLICATION:

Make sure to be in root directory of the project where manage.py is located. Then run these commands:

python3 manage.py migrate

python3 manage.py runserver


## Distinctiveness and Complexity:

It is distinct from the other projects created during this course. This web-app has an autocomplete for input of user from a big list of stocks in Indian stock market using python and jquery. In python, the csv file is returned to the browser where it is processed into an array using javascript and autocomplete is implemented using jquery.

This web-app is sufficiently complex as the status of trades is updated using fetch in javascript and the data and css on the front end is updated simuntaniously as if the page is reloaded wihtout actually reloading the page. It makes this web-app fast and responsive and the user doesn't have to scroll back or filter the trades again because the page reload is avoided and javascript is used instead to update the page.

The filter option for trades can either be last n trades (selected in dropdown) or the trades can be filtered using date range in the calender input. By default, last 10 trades are displayed without filtering.
The net profit or net loss is displayed for all the trades which are currently on the page.
